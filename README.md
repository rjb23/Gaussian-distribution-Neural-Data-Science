# Gaussian-distribution-Neural-Data-Science
In the context of neural data science, Gaussian refers to the Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution. The Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used to model random variables in many fields, including neuroscience and neural data analysis.
To work with Gaussian distributions in Python, you can use the SciPy library, which provides a wide range of functions and tools for scientific computing. The scipy.stats module within SciPy provides various statistical functions, including those related to the Gaussian distribution.
